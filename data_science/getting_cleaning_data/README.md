# Getting & Cleaning Data: README.md

## Repository Information
The purpose of this repo is to hold the Coursera Getting & Cleaning Data course project, and other course-related code or scripts. There are three files in the repo:

* _CodeBook.md_ - contains information about the variables, dataset, and any transformations that take place in the `run_analysis.R` script 
* _run\_analysis.R_ - contains the code used to transform the original dataset to a `tidy` dataset
* _README.md_ - contains information about the repo and the files inside the repo
 
The `run_analysis.R` script makes use of the `{dplyr}` library for some operations. Comments are included throughout to detail what each step is doing and why.
